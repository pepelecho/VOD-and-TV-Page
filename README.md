# VOD-and-TV-Page
An (almost) complete page layout for video on demand (Max, Netflix, M+ style) and TV. If you liked the design, do not hesitate to collaborate in its creation.

# How to install
Copy on your server and play!

# Litle issues
The TV guide for PC (Timeline) is not functional and contains errors. I would be delighted if you collaborated in its arrangement from the Issues section.

# Thanks
